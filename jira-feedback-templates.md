```

#### Template C2: Missing Error Details
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION NEEDED - ERROR MESSAGE SPECIFICS**

Your ticket describes the problem well but needs specific error messages for troubleshooting.

**Quality Score**: {score}/10

**Please provide**:
- **Exact error message**: Copy the text exactly as shown, or take a screenshot
- **Error timing**: When does the error appear? (during login, after clicking submit, etc.)
- **Error codes**: Any numbers or codes shown with the error

**Example**:
"Error message: 'Authentication failed - invalid credentials (Error Code: AUTH_401)'"
"This appears immediately after clicking 'Login' button"

**Screenshots help!** If possible, include a screenshot showing:
- The error message
- What you were trying to do when it happened
- The browser address bar (to confirm which page)

Adding these details will move your ticket directly to engineering.
```

#### Template C3: Missing Business Impact
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION NEEDED - BUSINESS IMPACT**

Your ticket has good technical details but needs business context for proper prioritization.

**Quality Score**: {score}/10

**Please provide**:
- **Who is affected**: Just you, your team, all customers, specific user group?
- **Business impact**: What work/process is blocked or disrupted?
- **Urgency**: How quickly does this need resolution?
- **Workarounds**: Is there any temporary way to accomplish the task?

**Example**:
"Affects all 25 customer service staff. Cannot process payments, blocking daily billing operations. Need resolution by EOD to avoid revenue impact. No workaround available."

This helps engineering prioritize your issue appropriately.
```

#### Template C4: Missing Reproduction Steps
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è CLARIFICATION NEEDED - REPRODUCTION STEPS**

Your ticket describes the issue but needs clear steps to reproduce the problem.

**Quality Score**: {score}/10

**Please provide step-by-step instructions**:
1. Start from a specific page or state
2. List each action taken (click, type, navigate)
3. Include what you expected to happen
4. Describe what actually happened instead

**Example**:
1. Navigate to Customer Portal login page
2. Enter username: user@company.com
3. Enter password: (correct password)
4. Click "Login" button
5. Expected: Dashboard should load
6. Actual: "Unauthorized access" error appears

**Additional helpful info**:
- Does this happen every time or only sometimes?
- Does it work on different browsers/devices?
- When did you first notice this problem?

Clear reproduction steps help engineering fix the issue faster.

**Required improvements**:
{specific_requirements_list}

**Template for resubmission**:
```
**Problem Summary**: [Specific issue in 1-2 sentences]

**Environment**:
- Browser: [Browser name and version]
- Operating System: [Windows/Mac/etc. version]
- Device: [Desktop/mobile/tablet]

**Issue Details**:

Please restructure your ticket using this template for faster processing.
```

#### Template R2: Generic Summary and Description
```
**‚ùå REVISION REQUIRED - SUMMARY TOO GENERIC**

Your ticket title and description need to be more specific for proper routing and prioritization.

**Quality Score**: {score}/10

**Current Issues**:
- Summary: "{current_summary}" is too generic
- Description lacks specific problem details

**Improvement needed**:

**Better Summary Examples**:
- Instead of: "Login Help"
- Use: "Users getting 'unauthorized' error during Customer Portal login"

- Instead of: "Payment Issue"  
- Use: "Credit card payments failing with timeout error in billing system"

**Better Description Structure**:
1. **Specific problem**: What exactly isn't working?
2. **Impact**: Who/what is affected?
3. **Error details**: Exact messages or symptoms
4. **Environment**: What system/browser/device?

**Before resubmitting**, ask yourself:
- Would someone else understand the problem from my title alone?
- Have I explained what I was trying to do?
- Have I included specific error messages or symptoms?
- Is it clear what business impact this has?

Please revise with these improvements.
```

#### Template R3: Authentication Issues - Special Handling
```
**‚ùå REVISION REQUIRED - AUTHENTICATION ISSUE NEEDS SECURITY REVIEW**
