# PENALTY_DUE DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS - FINAL INVESTIGATION

## üîç **GROUND TRUTH DATABASE EVIDENCE**

### **Customer 3178854 (Johanna Lyon) - Beach City Utilities**

**Current Balance**: $296.59  
**Company ID**: 1720  
**Configuration**: `penalty_print_total_bills=0`, `penalty_print_total_balance=0`, `penalty_print_percent=0.000000`

### **UNPOSTED BILLS (Method #3 Should Apply)**

| Bill ID | Amount | Penalty | Rate | include_balance_in_penalty |
|---------|--------|---------|------|---------------------------|
| 168604421 | $32.14 | $4.82 | 25428 | 0 |
| 168604422 | $11.22 | $1.68 | 25448 | 0 |
| 168604423 | $28.69 | $4.30 | 25456 | 0 |
| 168604424 | $155.80 | $23.37 | 25436 | 0 |
| 168604425 | $4.84 | $0.73 | 25450 | 0 |
| 168604426 | $6.24 | $0.94 | 25447 | 0 |

**Totals**: Bills = $238.93, Penalties = $35.84

## üßÆ **PENALTY CALCULATION VERIFICATION**

### **Individual Bill Penalties (bill_calculation_manager.rb:690)**
```ruby
# Since include_balance_in_penalty = 0 for all rates:
penalty_amount = (usage_charge_amount * penalty_percentage) + penalty_amount
```

**Verification**:
- $155.80 √ó 0.15 = $23.37 ‚úÖ
- $4.84 √ó 0.15 = $0.73 ‚úÖ
- $6.24 √ó 0.15 = $0.94 ‚úÖ
- $28.69 √ó 0.15 = $4.30 ‚úÖ
- $11.22 √ó 0.15 = $1.68 ‚úÖ
- $32.14 √ó 0.15 = $4.82 ‚úÖ

**All penalties in database are CORRECT.**

## üéØ **METHOD #3 PENALTY_DUE CALCULATION**

```ruby
# deposit_charges.rb:161
penalty_due = total_due + penalty_amount
```

**Step-by-step**:
```
Total Due = Current Balance + New Bills
Total Due = $296.59 + $238.93 = $535.52

Penalty_Due = Total Due + Sum of Individual Penalties
Penalty_Due = $535.52 + $35.84 = $571.36
```

## ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS**

### **Expected vs Actual**
- **Expected (Correct Logic)**: $571.36
- **Reported Actual**: $838.29
- **Difference**: $266.93

### **THEORIES TESTED**

#### **Theory 1**: ‚ùå Wrong baseline calculation
- Document 2 incorrectly calculated new bills as $166.88 vs actual $238.93
- Missing 3 bills in analysis

#### **Theory 2**: ‚ùå Including historical penalties
- Historical accrued penalties: $236.85
- Even with this: $535.52 + $35.84 + $236.85 = $808.21 ‚â† $838.29

#### **Theory 3**: ‚ùå Wrong penalty calculation method
- Verified Method #3 is correct for this company configuration
- Individual penalties match database exactly

## üö® **ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS**

The $838.29 figure is likely from:

1. **Statement Generation Bug**: Different calculation logic used during print/display
2. **Historical Data**: Additional charges not visible in current queries
3. **Compound Interest**: Multiple penalty cycles applied
4. **Rate Configuration Error**: Different penalty method being used in production

## üîß **RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION**

1. **Check print_helper_common.rb logic** for statement-specific calculations
2. **Query ALL customer transactions** including payments, adjustments, returns
3. **Verify penalty application dates** and multiple billing cycles
4. **Review actual PDF statement** for line-by-line breakdown

## ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED FINDINGS**

- ‚úÖ Database penalty amounts are mathematically correct
- ‚úÖ Method #3 calculation logic is properly implemented
- ‚úÖ Company configuration correctly points to Method #3
- ‚ùå $838.29 discrepancy remains unexplained by current data

**The bug is NOT in the core penalty calculation logic, but likely in statement generation or historical data accumulation.**
