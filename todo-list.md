## Todo List

- [ ] Answer initial board structure and flow questions
- [ ] Specify deployment window management process
- [ ] Define impediment tracking requirements
- [ ] Clarify WIP limit enforcement approach
- [ ] Create accountability-focused daily standup scenario with due date tracking and WIP enforcement
- [ ] Design impediment metrics and tracking system
- [ ] Build cycle time and lead time measurement implementation plan
- [ ] Show all items targeted for current release not yet in RC Review (risk list)
- [ ] Show items in RC Review with no Fix Version (need assignment)
- [ ] Show items that have missed 2+ version targets (chronic slippers)
- [ ] Evaluate: Should we focus on tracking items against RC Review deadline rather than deployment date?
