Total Due = Previous Balance + New Bills
Total Due = $296.59 + $238.93 = $535.52

## ‚ùå **DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS**

**Expected**: $571.36  
**Actual on Bill**: $838.29  
**Difference**: $266.93

### **Possible Explanations for $838.29:**

#### **Theory 1: Including Previous Balance in Penalty**
If `include_balance_in_penalty` was incorrectly set to 1:
```
Total with Balance = $296.59 + $238.93 = $535.52
15% Penalty on Total = $535.52 √ó 0.15 = $80.33
Penalty_Due = $535.52 + $80.33 = $615.85
```
Still doesn't reach $838.29.

#### **Theory 2: Additional Historical Bills/Charges**
The $838.29 may include:
- **Additional older bills** not captured in recent query
- **Late charges already applied** from previous periods
- **Interest charges** or other fees
- **Multiple penalty calculations** from different billing cycles

#### **Theory 3: Cumulative Penalty Application**
If penalties are being calculated recursively:
```
Base Amount: $535.52
First Penalty (15%): $535.52 + $80.33 = $615.85
Second Penalty (15%): $615.85 + $92.38 = $708.23
Additional charges: $708.23 + $130.06 = $838.29
```

## üîç **RECOMMENDED INVESTIGATION**

To verify the $838.29 calculation, check:

1. **All Historical Bills**: Query bills beyond the 6 recent ones
2. **Applied Late Charges**: Check for posted penalties from previous cycles  
3. **Interest Calculations**: Verify if interest is being added
4. **Payment History**: Check if returned payments affect penalty base
5. **Rate Configuration**: Verify if multiple rate tiers apply penalties differently
