# Generate test notes
cj-test SAAS-1234

# Apply tags directly to ticket
cj-tag SAAS-1234

# Break into subtasks
cj-task SAAS-1234

# Generate Root Cause Analysis
cj-rca SAAS-1234

# Generate release notes
cj-release SAAS-1234

# Monitor ticket queue for quality
agentj monitor --dry-run

# Use dry-run mode to preview without making changes
cj SAAS-1234 --dry-run

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NathanielGenwright/cj-buddy.git
cd cj-buddy
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
# Create shared .env file in parent directory (recommended for multi-project setup)
cp .env.example ../.env
# OR create local .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials:
# - JIRA_BASE_URL
# - JIRA_EMAIL  
# - JIRA_API_TOKEN (or JIRA_TOKEN for compatibility)
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or CLAUDE_API_KEY for compatibility)
```

4. Install shortcuts:
```bash
./install.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
CJ-Buddy now supports shared configuration for multi-project setups. The tool automatically looks for `.env` files in this order:
1. Parent directory (recommended for shared setup with AgentJ)
2. Current project directory (traditional setup)

### Jira Setup
1. Get your Jira API token from: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Add to `.env` file as `JIRA_API_TOKEN`

### Claude Setup
1. Get your Claude API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Add to `.env` file as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Shared Configuration (Recommended)
If you're using both CJ-Buddy and AgentJ, create a single `.env` file in the parent directory:
```bash
# In parent directory containing both cj-buddy/ and agentJ/
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key
```

This eliminates duplicate credentials and simplifies maintenance.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

python main.py TICKET-ID --mode MODE

## Dry-Run Mode

The `--dry-run` flag allows you to preview what any command would do without making actual changes to Jira. This is perfect for:

- **Testing configurations** before applying changes
- **Reviewing AI suggestions** before posting comments
- **Previewing tag suggestions** before applying labels
- **Validating output format** during development

### Dry-Run Features:
- ‚úÖ **No Jira Changes**: Comments, labels, and field updates are skipped
- ‚úÖ **Full Preview**: Shows complete AI-generated output
- ‚úÖ **Clear Indicators**: `[DRY RUN]` markers throughout the output  
- ‚úÖ **Same Analysis**: Uses identical AI prompts and processing
- ‚úÖ **Safe Testing**: Perfect for experimentation and validation

### Dry-Run Examples:
```bash
# Preview ticket analysis
cj-sum TRI-2279 --dry-run
# Shows: üìã ANALYSIS: TRI-2279 [DRY RUN]
#        üö® DRY RUN MODE - No changes will be made to Jira
#        üìù FULL OUTPUT: [complete analysis text]

# Preview tag suggestions  
cj-tag SAAS-1234 --dry-run
# Shows: üè∑Ô∏è TAGGING: SAAS-1234 [DRY RUN]
#        üìå Suggested tags (X): tag1 (would apply), tag2 (would apply)
#        üéØ [DRY RUN] Would apply tags: tag1, tag2, tag3

# Preview RCA generation
cj-rca SAAS-1761 --dry-run
# Shows: üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: SAAS-1761 [DRY RUN]  
#        üìù [DRY RUN] Would save RCA to file
#        üí¨ [DRY RUN] Would skip posting to Jira
```

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Feature

The RCA mode generates comprehensive Root Cause Analysis documents that include:

- **Incident Summary**: What happened, impact, and timeline

### Interactive Process:
1. **Issue Analysis**: Extracts key information from the Jira ticket
2. **Clarifying Questions**: Asks about user impact, business value, and limitations
3. **AI Generation**: Creates draft release notes using Claude AI
4. **Review & Edit**: Allows review, manual editing, or regeneration with feedback
5. **Field Update**: Appends final notes to the Instructions/Operational Notes field

### Release Note Formats:
- **‚ú® New**: For new features and capabilities
- **üêõ Fixed**: For bug fixes and corrections
- **‚ö° Improved**: For enhancements and optimizations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking**: For breaking changes requiring attention

### Features:
- **User-Centric Language**: Focuses on business value and user impact
- **Interactive Workflow**: Asks clarifying questions for better quality
- **Draft Review System**: Multiple rounds of review and editing
- **Automatic Timestamping**: Tracks when release notes were added
- **Field Preservation**: Appends to existing content rather than overwriting

Usage:
```bash
# Generate release notes for a ticket
cj-release SAAS-571

# Or use the full command
cj SAAS-571 --mode release-notes
```

## AgentJ - Ticket Monitoring Agent

AgentJ automatically monitors Jira ticket queues and validates ticket quality:

### Core Features:
- **Automated Validation**: Checks required fields, field rules, and severity-specific requirements
- **Approval Tagging**: Tickets passing all validations get `AJ-approved` label
- **Smart Re-evaluation**: Only re-checks tickets without approval labels
- **Reporter Alerts**: Posts helpful comments with improvement suggestions
- **Configurable Rules**: JSON-based validation configuration

### Monitoring Process:
1. **Queue Monitoring**: Continuously watches specified JQL filter
2. **Validation**: Checks each ticket against configured rules
3. **Approval**: Adds `AJ-approved` label if all validations pass
4. **Feedback**: Posts comment with improvement suggestions if issues found
5. **Re-evaluation**: Rechecks tickets in next cycle until approved

### Commands:
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
agentj monitor

# Run once in dry-run mode (no changes)
agentj monitor --once --dry-run

# Validate specific ticket
agentj validate SAAS-1234

# Force revalidation (removes approval first)
agentj revalidate SAAS-1234

# Show monitoring statistics
agentj status

# Create default config file
agentj init-config
```

### Configuration:
Edit `agentj_config.json` to customize:
- **JQL Filter**: Which tickets to monitor
- **Required Fields**: Fields that must be present
- **Field Rules**: Minimum length, patterns, allowed values
- **Severity Fields**: Additional requirements for Critical/High priority
- **Alert Methods**: Comment and/or label alerts

## Customization

### Modify Analysis Template
Edit the prompts in `main.py`:

```python
def generate_prompt(mode, summary, description):
    prompts = {
        "summarize": f"""Your custom template here...""",
        # ... other modes
    }
```
