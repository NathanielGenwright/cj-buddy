# PENALTY_DUE INVESTIGATION - TEAM BRIEFING

## üö® **THE PROBLEM**

**Customer**: Johanna Lyon (3178854) - Beach City Utilities  
**Issue**: Penalty amount on statement shows **$838.29** but should be **$571.36**  
**Impact**: **$266.93 overcharge** to customer  
**Status**: ‚ùå **ACTIVE BUG** - Root cause unknown

---

## üìä **WHAT WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN** ‚úÖ

### **Database Facts (100% Verified):**
```
‚úÖ Current Balance: $296.59
‚úÖ New Bills: $238.93 (6 bills)  
‚úÖ Individual Penalties: $35.84 (15% each bill)
‚úÖ Total Due: $535.52
‚úÖ Expected Penalty_Due: $571.36 (using Method #3)
```

### **Configuration Facts (100% Verified):**
```
‚úÖ Company flags: penalty_print_total_bills = 0, penalty_print_total_balance = 0
‚úÖ Rate flags: include_balance_in_penalty = 0 for all rates  
‚úÖ Customer flags: penalty_waived = 0
‚úÖ Should use Method #3: penalty_due = total_due + penalty_amount
```

### **Mathematical Verification:**
```
‚úÖ $296.59 + $238.93 + $35.84 = $571.36 ‚Üê CORRECT
‚ùå Actual statement shows: $838.29
‚ùå Unexplained gap: $266.93
```

## üîç **WHAT WE'VE RULED OUT**

| ‚ùå Theory | Why It's NOT the Cause |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Wrong penalty method | All methods tested, none produce $838.29 |
| Rate configuration error | All rates properly configured at 15% |  
| Include balance in penalty | Flag is 0, calculation verified |
| Document calculation mistakes | Multiple docs cross-verified |
| Database corruption | Individual penalties are mathematically correct |
| Company settings wrong | Settings confirmed to use Method #3 |

---

## üéØ **WHERE THE BUG LIKELY EXISTS**

### **üü• HIGH PROBABILITY:**
1. **Statement Generation Code**
   - `PrintStatementsJob` processing
   - Print helper penalty calculations
   - Statement template penalty fields

2. **Historical Data Accumulation**
   - Multiple penalty application cycles
   - Unpaid penalties from previous periods
   - Payment allocation affecting penalty base

### **üü® MEDIUM PROBABILITY:**
3. **Code Path Mixing**
   - Different methods used in different contexts
   - Invoice vs statement penalty calculations
   - Cached vs real-time calculations

### **üü© LOW PROBABILITY:**
4. **System Integration Issues**
   - Third-party system modifications
   - Database trigger effects
   - Environment-specific overrides

---

## üßÆ **THE MATH BREAKDOWN**

### **Current Calculation (Method #3):**
```ruby
penalty_due = total_due + penalty_amount
penalty_due = $535.52 + $35.84 = $571.36 ‚úÖ
```

### **Individual Bill Penalties:**
```
$155.80 √ó 15% = $23.37 ‚úÖ
$4.84   √ó 15% = $0.73  ‚úÖ  
$6.24   √ó 15% = $0.94  ‚úÖ
$28.69  √ó 15% = $4.30  ‚úÖ
$11.22  √ó 15% = $1.68  ‚úÖ
$32.14  √ó 15% = $4.82  ‚úÖ
Total: $35.84
```

### **The Mystery:**
```
Expected: $571.36
Actual:   $838.29
Gap:      $266.93 ‚Üê WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM?
```

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **üî• URGENT (Next 24 Hours):**

**1. Generate Actual PDF Statement**
- Run statement generation for customer 3178854
- Compare PDF line-by-line with database
- Document where $838.29 appears

**2. Enable Debug Logging**
```ruby
# Add to deposit_charges.rb and email_manager.rb
Rails.logger.debug "PENALTY DEBUG: penalty_due=#{penalty_due}"
```

**3. Run PrintStatementsJob with Logging**
- Execute with customer 3178854
- Capture all penalty calculations
- Trace data flow through system

### **üìã THIS WEEK:**

**4. Historical Data Analysis**
- Query ALL customer transactions
- Build complete payment/penalty timeline
- Verify balance reconciliation

**5. Code Path Investigation**  
- Map complete billing workflow
- Check print helper calculations
- Review statement templates

## ü§î **BRAINSTORMING QUESTIONS**

### **For Development Team:**
1. Are there any **Beach City specific penalty overrides** in the code?
2. Could this be a **compound penalty calculation** from multiple cycles?
3. Are there any **Lansford-specific penalty additions** (we saw $25 fee)?
4. Could **statement generation use different logic** than database calculation?

### **For Business Team:**
1. Has the customer had **returned payments** that might affect penalty base?
2. Are there **additional fees** not captured in the bills table?
3. Could this be **interest charges** in addition to penalties?
4. Are there **regulatory requirements** for penalty calculations we're missing?

### **For Support Team:**
1. Have other customers reported similar penalty discrepancies?
2. When did this customer first report the issue?
3. Are there similar issues with other Beach City customers?

## üîß **TECHNICAL REFERENCE**

### **Key Files to Review:**
```
lib/services/bills/statement_data/deposit_charges.rb:156
lib/services/bills/email_manager.rb:253  
lib/print_helper_common.rb:7
app/jobs/accounting/document_processors/printable_invoice_decorator.rb:23
```

### **Key Database Queries:**
```sql
-- Customer penalty status
SELECT penalty_waived FROM customers WHERE id = 3178854;

-- Bill penalties  
SELECT penalty_amount FROM bills WHERE customer_id = 3178854 AND posted_customer = 0;

-- Company settings
SELECT penalty_print_total_bills, penalty_print_total_balance FROM companies WHERE id = 1720;
```

## üí¨ **DISCUSSION & QUESTIONS**

**This is where we need team input:**
- What other code paths might calculate penalties?
- Are there any recent changes to penalty logic?
- Could timing/date calculations affect penalty amounts?
- What other data sources might contribute to the $838.29?

**Let's solve this together and protect our customers from incorrect charges!**
