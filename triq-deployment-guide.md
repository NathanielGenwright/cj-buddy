# TriQ Deployment Guide
## Engineering Portal JIRA Triage Validation System

### Overview
This guide provides complete deployment instructions for the TriQ (JIRA Triage Validator) system for automated quality validation of Engineering Portal tickets.

---

## System Components

### Core Files Created
1. **`jira-triage-quality-rubric.md`** - Quality scoring framework (0-10 scale)
2. **`jira-validation-rules.md`** - Automated validation logic and criteria
3. **`jira-feedback-templates.md`** - Standardized response templates
4. **`triq-workflows.md`** - Operational procedures and workflows
5. **`triq-monitor.sh`** - Executable monitoring script
6. **`triq-deployment-guide.md`** - This deployment guide

### System Architecture
```
User submits ticket → TriQ Agent → Validation Rules → Quality Scoring → 
Template Selection → Feedback Generation → JIRA Comment + Labels
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Validation Testing ✅
- [x] ACLI connectivity confirmed to Engineering Portal (EP) project
- [x] Validation rules tested on sample ticket EP-4
- [x] Quality scoring algorithm validated (3.4/10 score for EP-4)
- [x] Feedback template selection working (security override for Template R3)
- [x] Special case handling operational (authentication issue detection)

### Phase 2: Production Setup

#### Step 1: Environment Verification
```bash
# Verify JIRA connectivity
acli jira project list --limit 5

# Confirm Engineering Portal access
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP" --count

# Test ticket access
acli jira workitem view EP-4
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Monitoring Script
```bash
# Set executable permissions
chmod +x /Users/munin8/_myprojects/triq-monitor.sh

# Test monitoring run
./triq-monitor.sh

# Review logs
cat /tmp/triq-monitor.log
cat /tmp/triq-daily-report.txt
```

#### Step 3: Schedule Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Add to crontab for every 4 hours monitoring
crontab -e

# Add this line:
0 */4 * * * /Users/munin8/_myprojects/triq-monitor.sh >> /tmp/triq-monitor.log 2>&1
```

### Phase 3: Production Enablement

#### Enable Live Feedback Posting
Edit `triq-monitor.sh` to enable actual JIRA operations:

**Current (safe mode):**
```bash
# acli jira workitem comment "$ticket_key" --body "$(cat "$feedback_file")"
log "(In demo mode - feedback not posted to JIRA)"
```

**Production (live mode):**
```bash
acli jira workitem comment "$ticket_key" --body "$(cat "$feedback_file")"
log "Feedback posted to $ticket_key"
```

#### Enable Label Management
**Current (safe mode):**
```bash
# acli jira workitem edit "$ticket_key" --labels "$VALIDATION_LABEL,quality_score_$SCORE"
log "Would add labels: $VALIDATION_LABEL,quality_score_$SCORE"
```

**Production (live mode):**
```bash
acli jira workitem edit "$ticket_key" --labels "$VALIDATION_LABEL,quality_score_$SCORE"
log "Labels updated for $ticket_key"
```

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations

#### Morning Health Check (9 AM)
```bash
# Run comprehensive monitoring
./triq-monitor.sh

# Review overnight tickets
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND created >= -12h ORDER BY created DESC"

# Check validation metrics
grep "Quality Score" /tmp/triq-monitor.log | tail -10
```

#### Ad-hoc Ticket Validation
```bash
# Validate specific ticket using TriQ
claude code
# Then ask: "TriQ, please validate ticket EP-XXX"

# Quick quality check
acli jira workitem view EP-XXX
# Apply manual validation using jira-validation-rules.md
```

#### Weekly Review (Monday 10 AM)
```bash
# Generate weekly metrics
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND created >= -7d" --count
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (quality_score_high) AND created >= -7d" --count
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (needs_revision) AND created >= -7d" --count

# Review validation accuracy
grep -c "APPROVED" /tmp/triq-monitor.log
grep -c "REVISION" /tmp/triq-monitor.log
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### High-Priority Ticket Alert
```bash
# Check for emergency tickets
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND priority = High AND status = 'To Do'"

# Manual TriQ validation for emergencies
claude code
# Request: "TriQ, emergency validation for ticket EP-XXX"
```

#### System Issues
```bash
# If monitoring script fails
tail -50 /tmp/triq-monitor.log

# If ACLI connectivity issues
acli jira project list --limit 1

# If validation seems inaccurate
# Review rules in jira-validation-rules.md
# Check template selection logic in jira-feedback-templates.md
```

## Quality Metrics and KPIs

### Success Metrics
- **Validation Rate**: >95% of new tickets validated within 4 hours
- **Quality Improvement**: Average ticket score >7.0 within 90 days
- **Revision Rate**: <20% of tickets requiring major revision
- **Engineering Satisfaction**: >90% satisfaction with ticket quality

### Monitoring Queries
```bash
# Daily validation metrics
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND created >= -1d" --count
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (triq_validated) AND created >= -1d" --count

# Quality score distribution
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (quality_score_high)" --count
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (quality_score_medium)" --count  
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (quality_score_low)" --count

# Feedback effectiveness
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels IN (needs_revision) AND updated >= -7d" --count
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "No tickets found requiring validation"
**Cause**: All recent tickets already have validation labels  
**Solution**: Normal operation; check older unvalidated tickets
```bash
acli jira workitem search --jql "project = EP AND labels NOT IN (triq_validated)" --limit 10
```

#### Issue: "ERROR: Cannot connect to JIRA"
**Cause**: ACLI authentication or network issues  
**Solution**: Refresh ACLI authentication
```bash
acli auth list
acli auth login --jira
```

#### Issue: Validation scores seem incorrect
**Cause**: Rule logic may need adjustment  
**Solution**: Manual validation comparison
1. Run TriQ validation on sample ticket
2. Compare to manual scoring using rubric
3. Adjust rules in `jira-validation-rules.md` if needed

#### Issue: Templates not posting correctly
**Cause**: ACLI command formatting or permissions  
**Solution**: Test comment posting manually
```bash
acli jira workitem comment EP-4 --body "Test comment"
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Check recent monitoring activity
tail -100 /tmp/triq-monitor.log

# Find validation errors
grep -i error /tmp/triq-monitor.log

# Track validation results
grep "Validation Result" /tmp/triq-monitor.log | tail -20

# Monitor system performance
grep "completed successfully" /tmp/triq-monitor.log | wc -l
```
