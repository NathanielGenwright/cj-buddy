# **Do Not Share Information** Privacy Feature

## **What This Feature Does**

The "Do Not Share Information" checkbox is a **privacy protection flag** that controls whether a customer's contact information and address details can be included in certain reports and data exports generated by utility staff.

## **When This Flag Is Enabled (Checked ✅)**

**Customer information is EXCLUDED from:**
- **Customer Address Reports** - Used by staff to generate mailing lists, contact directories, and address labels
- **Data Exports** - When utility staff export customer information to Excel or other formats  
- **Third-Party Sharing** - Prevents customer details from being included in reports that might be shared with contractors, vendors, or other parties

**Customer information is STILL INCLUDED in:**
- Monthly billing statements and notices
- Payment processing and account management
- Service calls and utility operations
- Regulatory reporting (as required by law)

## **How It Works**

When utility staff generate **Customer Address Reports**, they can filter by this setting:
- **"All"** - Include all customers regardless of privacy setting
- **"Yes"** - Show only customers who have opted OUT of information sharing
- **"No"** - Show only customers who have NOT opted out (default)

If a customer has this flag enabled, their record will be **automatically excluded** when staff select "No" or "All" for the privacy filter, protecting their information from routine address exports and contact lists.

## **What Information Is Protected**

When enabled, this flag protects:
- Name and contact details
- Billing and service addresses  
- Phone numbers (billing, service, work, cell)
- Email addresses
- Account numbers and service details

## **Important Notes**

✅ **This does NOT affect billing or essential utility services**  
✅ **Your account remains fully functional for payments and service**  
✅ **This only limits inclusion in staff-generated contact reports**  
⚠️ **Required regulatory reporting may still include your information as mandated by law**

## **When You Might Want This Feature**

Consider enabling this if you:
- Prefer maximum privacy protection
- Don't want your information shared with contractors or vendors
- Want to opt out of any non-essential contact lists
- Have privacy concerns about data exports
