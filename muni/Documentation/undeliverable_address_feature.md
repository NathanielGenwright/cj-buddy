# **Undeliverable Address** Feature Analysis & Documentation

## **⚠️ CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED**

### **Form Mapping Issue**
There is a **bug in the customer form** at `/muni-billing/legacy/app/views/customers/_beta_form.html.erb:465` where both:
- **"Do Not Share Information?"** 
- **"Undeliverable Address?"**

...are both incorrectly mapped to the same database field: `do_not_share_information`

### **Recommended Fix**
The "Undeliverable Address?" checkbox should be mapped to the `exclude_third_party_printing` field instead, based on the intended functionality described below.

---

## **What "Undeliverable Address" Feature Should Do**

### **Purpose**
The "Undeliverable Address" flag should mark customers whose mailing addresses are **undeliverable** by postal services, preventing wasted printing and mailing costs for bills that cannot be delivered.

### **Intended Database Field: `exclude_third_party_printing`**

Based on codebase analysis, this feature should control the `exclude_third_party_printing` field, which:

### **When This Flag Is Enabled (Checked ✅)**

**Customer bills are EXCLUDED from:**
- **Third-Party Printing Services** - External mail processing companies
- **Bulk Mail Processing** - Mass printing and mailing operations  
- **Physical Bill Delivery** - Prevents printing bills that cannot be delivered

**Customer bills are STILL PROCESSED for:**
- Electronic delivery (email bills)
- Customer portal access
- Account management and payments
- Internal utility operations

### **How It Works Technically**

The system uses this logic in printing operations:
```sql
WHERE customers.exclude_third_party_printing = false
```

When the flag is **enabled** (`exclude_third_party_printing = true`):
- Customer is **filtered OUT** of standard bill printing batches
- Bills are **not sent** to third-party mail processing
- **Saves costs** on undeliverable mail

### **Business Logic**

**File**: `/muni-billing/legacy/lib/services/printing/manager.rb:798`
```ruby
if exclude_third_party_printing
  exclude_printing_clause = " and customers.exclude_third_party_printing = false "
elsif print_excluded_third_party  
  exclude_printing_clause = " and customers.exclude_third_party_printing = true "
end
```

**File**: `/muni-billing/legacy/app/helpers/billing_print_helper.rb:48`
```sql
WHERE customers.exclude_third_party_printing = false 
  and customers.deliver_bill_mail = true
```

### **Usage Statistics**
- **44 companies** currently have customers with this flag enabled
- **3,982 total customers** across all companies have undeliverable addresses flagged
- **Pioneer Energy Management** has the highest count with 1,879 customers

### **When Utilities Should Enable This**

Mark addresses as "undeliverable" when:
- **Mail is returned** as undeliverable by postal service
- **Customer has moved** with no forwarding address
- **Address is incorrect** and cannot be corrected
- **Building is vacant** or demolished
- **Repeated delivery failures** occur

### **What This Protects Against**

✅ **Reduces printing costs** for bills that won't be delivered  
✅ **Saves postage** on undeliverable mail  
✅ **Prevents mail returns** and processing fees  
✅ **Improves delivery statistics** and postal relationships  
✅ **Reduces environmental waste** from undelivered mail

### **Important Notes**

⚠️ **This does NOT stop billing** - charges still apply  
⚠️ **Customer must arrange alternative delivery** (email, pickup)  
⚠️ **May require additional collection efforts** for unpaid bills  
⚠️ **Should be used with email billing** when possible

### **Recommended User Interface**

Instead of "Undeliverable Address?", consider clearer labels:
- **"Exclude from Mail Delivery"**
- **"Address Undeliverable by Mail"**  
- **"Do Not Print/Mail Bills"**
- **"Mail Delivery Failed"**

## **ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Immediate Fix Needed**
1. **Correct the form mapping** in `_beta_form.html.erb`
2. **Map "Undeliverable Address?"** to `exclude_third_party_printing` field
3. **Ensure "Do Not Share Information?"** remains mapped to `do_not_share_information`
4. **Test form functionality** after the fix
5. **Update any related documentation** or training materials

### **Technical Implementation**
```erb
<!-- CURRENT (INCORRECT) -->
<%= f.check_box :do_not_share_information %>  <!-- Used for both labels -->

<!-- SHOULD BE -->
<%= f.check_box :exclude_third_party_printing %>  <!-- For "Undeliverable Address?" -->
<%= f.check_box :do_not_share_information %>      <!-- For "Do Not Share Information?" -->
```

### **Database Verification Query**
```sql
-- Check current usage of exclude_third_party_printing
SELECT 
    co.name as company_name,
    COUNT(c.id) as undeliverable_addresses
FROM companies co
INNER JOIN customers c ON co.id = c.company_id 
WHERE c.exclude_third_party_printing = 1
GROUP BY co.id, co.name
ORDER BY undeliverable_addresses DESC;
```
