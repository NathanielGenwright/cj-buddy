# SAAS-1354 Feature Summary: Improved Failed Fee Handling for Paya Connect

## Overview
**Release Date:** May 28, 2025  
**Author:** Drago Todorov  
**Business Impact:** Enhanced payment processing reliability for Paya Connect customers  

## What This Feature Does

### Problem Solved
Previously, when customers made payments through the **Paya Connect** payment gateway with convenience fees, both the base payment AND the convenience fee had to succeed for the payment to be considered successful. If the convenience fee failed but the base payment succeeded, the entire transaction was marked as failed, causing:
- Customer confusion (their payment was processed but showed as failed)
- Administrative overhead (staff had to manually investigate "failed" payments)
- Customer service issues (customers would attempt to re-pay, causing double payments)

### Solution Implemented
**SAAS-1354** introduces **partial success handling** specifically for **Paya Connect** payments:

- **For Paya Connect:** A payment is now considered **successful** if the base transaction succeeds, even if the convenience fee fails
- **For Heartland (unchanged):** Both base payment and convenience fee must succeed for the payment to be considered successful
- **For payments without fees:** Behavior remains unchanged - base payment success determines overall success

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

#### Payment Success Logic (`lib/charges/purchasers/charge_references.rb:15-26`)
```ruby
def successful_purchase?
  if paya_connect?
    # per SAAS-1354, having a successful base transaction is enough for Paya
    base_success?
  elsif should_have_fee?
    # We still require full success for heartland with fee
    base_success? && fee_success?
  else
    #... and without fee
    base_success?
  end
end
```

#### Architecture Improvements
- **New Payment Processing Framework:** Complete overhaul of payment processing with new abstractions (`lib/charges/purchasers/`, `lib/charges/bridges/`)
- **Enhanced Charge Explorer:** New administrative tools for investigating payment processing issues
- **Improved Error Handling:** Better distinction between different types of payment failures
- **Streamlined Codebase:** Removed 8,331 lines of deprecated code while adding 8,659 lines of improved functionality

## User Impact

### For Customers
- **Reduced Payment Failures:** Payments that previously showed as "failed" will now correctly show as "successful" when the base payment processes
- **Less Confusion:** Clear distinction between payment success and fee processing issues
- **Fewer Double Payments:** Customers won't attempt to re-pay when they see a "failed" status for successful base payments

### For Administrative Staff
- **Clearer Payment Status:** Better visibility into which part of a transaction failed (base payment vs. convenience fee)
- **Reduced Investigation Time:** New charge explorer tools for troubleshooting payment issues
- **Better Reporting:** Enhanced payment processing reports and analytics

### For Utility Companies
- **Improved Cash Flow:** Successful base payments are immediately recognized as successful
- **Reduced Support Overhead:** Fewer customer service calls about "failed" payments
- **Better Reconciliation:** Clearer separation between payment processing and fee collection

## Gateway-Specific Behavior

| Payment Gateway | Base Payment Success | Convenience Fee Success | Overall Status |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Paya Connect** | ✅ Success | ❌ Failed | ✅ **SUCCESS** (New) |
| **Paya Connect** | ✅ Success | ✅ Success | ✅ SUCCESS |
| **Paya Connect** | ❌ Failed | N/A | ❌ FAILED |
| **Heartland** | ✅ Success | ❌ Failed | ❌ FAILED (Unchanged) |
| **Heartland** | ✅ Success | ✅ Success | ✅ SUCCESS |
| **Any Gateway** | ✅ Success | No Fee | ✅ SUCCESS |

## Related Enhancements

This feature builds upon previous improvements to payment processing:
- **SAAS-559:** Enhanced handling of failed convenience fees (foundation work)

## Deployment Notes

- **Backward Compatible:** No changes to existing payment forms or customer-facing interfaces
- **Database Changes:** No schema modifications required
- **Configuration:** No additional configuration needed
- **Testing:** Extensive test coverage including edge cases for partial payment success scenarios
