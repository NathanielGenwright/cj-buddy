## üîç **Key Insights for Action**

### **üö® Immediate Priorities**
1. **TRI-2302**: Critical payment issue unassigned (TriQ: 4.0)
2. **22 tickets** with TriQ scores ‚â§ 4.0 need immediate review
3. **Multiple enhancement requests** awaiting product management triage

### **üìä Pattern Recognition**
- **Payment Processing**: Consistently high urgency, needs dedicated specialist
- **Jim Wells (CID 1833)**: Multiple critical tickets - client review needed
- **Enhancement Requests**: High quality documentation but lacking assignment

### **üèÜ Excellence Examples**
- **TRI-2301**: TriQ Score 8.3 - Use as billing issue template
