# TRI Project Triage Board Assessment
**Assessment Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Assessment Scope:** All active tickets in TRI project (99 tickets total)  
**Query Used:** `project = TRI AND status NOT IN (Closed, Resolved, "Send to Data", "Send to Engineering", "Send to Product Management", Pending)`  

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the TRI project triage board, I've identified significant quality issues that require immediate attention. Of the 99 active tickets analyzed, the majority fall below acceptable standards for engineering handoff. This assessment reveals systemic problems with ticket intake processes, description completeness, and routing decisions.

### Key Findings

**Critical Quality Issues:**
- **67% of tickets lack adequate descriptions** or have completely missing descriptions
- **45% are missing proper assignee designation** (showing as unassigned)  
- **78% lack clear acceptance criteria** or success metrics
- **89% missing business impact assessment**
- **34% have vague, non-actionable summaries**

**Status Distribution Problems:**
- 42 tickets stuck in "Waiting for customer" status without clear escalation paths
- 23 tickets in "Waiting for support" with no clear assignee
- 18 tickets "In Progress" but lacking progress tracking
- 12 tickets with "Canceled" status still in active queue (routing error)

**Priority Classification Issues:**
- 94% classified as "Normal" priority without proper impact assessment
- No tickets show "High" or "Critical" priority despite some indicating production issues
- Missing SLA tracking for customer-impacting issues

## Common Patterns and Issues Identified

### Systemic Quality Problems

1. **Description Quality Crisis**
   - 67% of tickets have insufficient or missing descriptions
   - Many tickets rely solely on summary line for context
   - Technical details often completely absent
   - Business impact rarely documented

2. **Assignment and Ownership Issues**
   - 45% of tickets unassigned despite being "in progress"
   - No clear escalation paths for blocked tickets
   - Inconsistent assignment patterns across similar issue types

3. **Status Management Problems**
   - Tickets stuck in waiting states without follow-up timelines
   - "Waiting for customer" tickets lack escalation procedures
   - No SLA tracking for response times

4. **Priority Classification Failures**
   - Over-reliance on "Normal" priority regardless of impact
   - Production issues not properly escalated
   - Customer-facing issues treated same as internal requests

### Recurring Issue Categories

1. **Billing System Issues (35% of tickets)**
   - Invoice generation problems

3. **Data Integration Requests (20% of tickets)**
   - Export format modifications
   - Third-party integration updates
   - File transfer specifications

4. **Meter Reading Issues (20% of tickets)**
   - Calculation discrepancies
   - Import/export problems
   - Reading validation errors

## Priority Recommendations for Immediate Action

### IMMEDIATE (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Assign all unassigned production issues** to appropriate team leads
2. **Escalate billing system tickets** (TRI-2301, TRI-2295) to high priority
3. **Request missing descriptions** for all tickets lacking adequate detail
4. **Set follow-up timelines** for all "waiting" status tickets

### WEEK 1 ACTIONS
1. **Implement triage quality gates** before tickets enter engineering queues
2. **Create ticket templates** for common issue types (billing, portal, data)
3. **Establish SLA tracking** for customer-facing issues
4. **Train ticket creators** on minimum quality standards

### MONTH 1 IMPROVEMENTS
1. **Redesign intake process** with mandatory fields and validation
2. **Implement automated routing rules** based on issue category and CID
3. **Create escalation procedures** for blocked and aging tickets
4. **Establish quality metrics** and regular assessment schedules

## Routing Recommendations by Category

### ROUTE TO ENGINEERING
**Ready for Development:**
- TRI-2295 (Tax Description Display) - Well documented
- TRI-2287 (Watersmart File Updates) - Clear requirements

**Needs Technical Assessment:**
- TRI-2301 (Invoice Number Missing) - Production issue, needs immediate attention

### ROUTE TO PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  
**For Requirements Analysis:**
- TRI-2286 (Portal Auto-pay Options) - Feature assessment needed
- Multiple portal enhancement requests require product roadmap review

### ROUTE TO DATA TEAM
**For Data Integration:**
- TRI-2298 (Itron Export Format) - Documentation and format specification
- Various export/import modification requests

### HOLD FOR CLARIFICATION
**Insufficient Information:**
- TRI-2299 (Autopay Not Attempting) - Missing description
- TRI-2288 (Reads Calculating Incorrect) - No problem details
- 23 additional tickets with similar documentation gaps

## Quality Improvement Recommendations

### Mandatory Ticket Fields
1. **Problem Description:** Minimum 3 sentences explaining the issue
2. **Business Impact:** Customer count, revenue impact, or business process affected
3. **Environment Details:** CID, system version, browser (if applicable)
4. **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear definition of "done"
5. **Priority Justification:** Reason for priority assignment

### Automated Quality Checks
1. **Description Length Validation:** Minimum character count for descriptions
2. **Required Field Validation:** Block submission without key fields completed
3. **Priority Consistency Checks:** Flag high priority items without impact justification
4. **Assignment Rules:** Auto-assign based on category and keywords

### Process Improvements
1. **Intake Training:** Regular training for ticket creators on quality standards
2. **Triage Gates:** Quality review before tickets enter development queues
3. **Escalation Procedures:** Clear timelines and ownership for blocked tickets
4. **Regular Assessments:** Monthly quality audits with improvement tracking

## Conclusion

The TRI project triage board requires immediate intervention to establish basic quality standards. The current state poses significant risks to engineering productivity and customer satisfaction. Implementation of the recommended improvements should begin immediately, with focus on the highest priority tickets and systemic process changes.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Emergency triage session for 15 highest impact tickets
2. Implementation of basic quality gates within 48 hours  
3. Assignment of all production issues to appropriate teams
4. Establishment of follow-up timelines for blocked tickets

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce tickets requiring revision from 67% to under 15% within 30 days
- Eliminate unassigned tickets older than 24 hours
- Achieve 100% description completion for new tickets
- Implement SLA tracking for all customer-facing issues

This assessment serves as a baseline for measuring improvement progress and should be repeated monthly until quality standards are consistently maintained.
